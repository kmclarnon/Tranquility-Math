Tranquility-Math
================

Math library for the Tranquility Engine

This library will contain all math functions and structures to support those functions that will be required by the Tranquility Engine

Current Features
----------------
While the library is still under construction, there are a few features already implemented
### Basic Types
* **Float:** implements a class wrapper for a single-percision floating point, correctly handles equality and comparisons  
* **Dual:** implements a class to represent a dual number, specifically usefull for automatic differentiation.  

### Structures
* **Point2D:** implements a basic point object in 2 dimensional space  
* **Point3D:** implements a basic point object in 3 dimensional space  
* **Vector2D:** similar to a point, offers additional functionality for vector mathematics  
* **Vector3D:** vector operations in 3 dimensional space
